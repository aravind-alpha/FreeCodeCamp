          Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
          The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things
          differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for
          the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or
          vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because
          they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some
          may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who
          are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who
          do.

                    Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and
                    the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe
                    is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love
                    what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.
                    Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know
                    when you find it.

                    You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only
                    connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the
                    dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust
                    in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
                    This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the
                    difference in my life.

                    When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the
                    way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the
                    world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have
                    a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a
                    very limited life. Life can be much broader once you
                    discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you
                    call life was made up by people that were no smarter than
                    you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you
                    learn that, you’ll never be the same again.

                    Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know
                    to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
                    You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your
                    heart.
